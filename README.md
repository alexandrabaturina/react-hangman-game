# Hangman Game
## Overview
**Hangman Game** is a simple hangman game made with JavaScript and React. This project is built based on [This Is A Great Beginner React/TypeScript Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ONUyenGnWw&t=1s&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified) YouTube video. The code is modified from its original version by using JavaScript instead of TypeScript.

The goal of the project is to practice with:

* Managing state in React
* [useCallback](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecallback) and [useEffect](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect) hooks
